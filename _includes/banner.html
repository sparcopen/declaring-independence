      <p>With subscription prices continuing to rise and library budgets strained to the point of unsustainability, many scholars are taking a hard look at what they can personally do to make research more widely available, more quickly, and more equitably. One manifestation of scholarsâ€™ move towards openness is the resignation of editors and editorial boards from high-priced commercial journals to start open access alternatives. Researchers, who contribute their expertise and their prestige to articles that they write, edit and produce, are increasingly making this move as a way to take back control and ownership of their outputs for the academy.</p>
