      <p>With subscription prices continuing to rise and library budgets strained to the point of unsustainability, many scholars are taking a hard look at what they can personally do to make research more widely available, more quickly, and more equitably. One manifestation of scholarsâ€™ move towards openness is the resignation of editors and editorial boards from high-priced commercial journals to start open access alternatives. Researchers, who contribute their expertise and their prestige to articles that they write, edit and produce, are increasingly making this move as a way to take back control and ownership of their outputs for the academy.</p>

      <p>"We scientists can exercise control of our journals. We can transform them from commercial commodities back to instruments of service to education and research. When we are in control, we fulfill our responsibility to ourselves, to society, to our institutions, and to our colleagues throughout the world" - Dr Person, Editor at Journal</p>
