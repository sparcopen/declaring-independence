## Your journal’s primary goal:  Serving your community

As an editor or editorial board member of a scholarly journal, you may be unaware of subscription patterns and pricing histories in the journal publishing industry. After all, your primary job is to focus on journal content -- to make sure that the latest and best research is published. When societies published most research, scholars often assumed that these organizations were managing and pricing the journals with an eye toward reaching their intended audiences around the world. But the reality today has changed. Some publishers charge readers high prices for the journals they publish. That has led to broad scale subscription cancellations and narrower dissemination. More and more editorial boards have found that they must become involved in the business aspects of their commercially published journals if they are to be sure these essential publications remain accessible to their intended communities.

Fundamentally, then, the question you and your fellow editors must ask yourselves is,”Is our journal’s distribution model optimized to truly serve our community?” If your answer is no, and if you have found it difficult to engage your publisher to address your concerns about access and pricing, take the following diagnostic to better understand your options.

## Is open access a fit? A simple diagnostic tool  

NOTE:  The steps described below assume that your editorial board has attempted, without success, to reach an accord with the journal’s publisher on opening access to the journal’s content. They also assume that the parties differ on the principal issue of whether 100% of the content should be open, as opposed to important, but less critical OA doctrinal differences (e.g., which Creative Commons license(s) to allow).

## Determining Ownership

Your editorial board’s first step in assessing its options is to determine who owns the assets of the journal, most importantly the journal’s name and content. There are three common scenarios:

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#tab-1" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">
  <button class="btn-outline">A society (or other nonprofit entity) owns the journal, but publishes it in collaboration with a third-party (for example, a commercial publisher or university press)</button>
  </a></li>
    <li><a href="#tab-2" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">
  <button class="btn-outline">A commercial or nonprofit publisher owns the journal, and contracts with a society and/or individual editors to supply peer reviewed content</button>
  </a></li>
    <li><a href="#tab-3" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">
  <button class="btn-outline">A society (or other nonprofit) owns the journal and its content</button>
  </a></li>
  </ul>
  </div>

## If a Society or Nonprofit Owns the Journal but Collaborates with a Third Party to Publish...

STEP→  If the society or other nonprofit owns the journal and contracts for publishing support services, you should determine when the term of its publishing agreement ends. Publishing agreements typically run for five- or seven-year terms and renew automatically (for one- or three-year terms). The advance notice required for intent to renegotiate or terminate the agreement tends to range from 180 days to 18 months. This information will determine the timeframe for evaluating your options for the journal.

STEP→ Once the society or nonprofit has determined the timeframe for its decision, you can work to estimate the costs required to operate the journal.  This should encompass all essential editorial activities, including any costs that may have been covered previously by the publishing partner.  The costs will also include any publishing platform expenses. Publishing platform options range from fully featured, but expensive, commercial platforms to capable, less expensive (even free), options from nonprofit providers.

STEP→ Once your editorial board has a sense of the journal’s cost structure, you can evaluate options for sustaining the journal financially. Common funding approaches include:

* Subsidizing the operation of an open access journal out of other society revenues. If the society generates sufficient surplus revenue (from member dues, meeting registration fees, sponsorships, etc.), it might be able to cover some or all the journal’s costs out of that surplus.
* Funding the journal via article processing charges (APCs). Sustaining a journal via APCs is most likely to succeed in disciplines with a tradition of page charges (e.g., biomedicine, life sciences, etc.) and/or where a substantial percentage of a journal’s content is the result of funded research.
* Participating in an institutional or collective support model with other journals. A growing number of academic institutions provide support for open access journals. Some of these resources require an institutional affiliation (for example, one of the editors must associated with the university), while others support any open access journal that practices rigorous peer review. Additionally, at least one initiative - Open Library of the Humanities - seeks collective funding for qualifying journals.
* Funding the journal through contributions from multiple institutions.

  <h4><i>If the Journal is Owned by a Third Party Uninterested in Moving to Open Access…</i></h4>
  If the journal is owned by a third-party that is not interested in accommodating your editorial board’s desire for open access dissemination, you will typically have little recourse beyond terminating your relationship with the journal and pursuing other publishing options.

  <b><i>STEP→ </i></b>In this case, your editorial board should review any agreement you may have entered with the journal’s publisher to determine whether you are contractually constrained from starting or participating in a competing journal. If your editorial contract has such a clause, you should seek qualified legal advice before proceeding further.

  If qualified legal advice indicates that your editor’s agreement with the publisher prevents you from starting or participating in a new journal, then the editorial group’s options might be limited to:
  <ul>
    <li>Renewing negotiations with the publisher in an attempt to gain partial concessions that would increase the openness of the journal short of comprehensive open access. Such concessions might include broader author rights, such as more <a href="https://sparcopen.org/our-work/author-rights/">progressive self-archiving policies</a>.</li>
    <li>Resigning from the journal’s editorial board and withholding any future support for the journal (e.g., as authors, peer reviewers, etc.). Again, your behavior will need to conform with any qualified legal advice.</li>
  </ul>

</ul>

    <div id="tab-3">

      <h4><i>If a Society or Nonprofit Owns the Journal and the Content…</i></h4>
  If the journal is owned by a society or nonprofit, this should increase the likelihood that your editorial board and the publisher are able to reach a shared understanding as to why open access benefits your community. However, if such accord cannot be reached, you might need to seek a new publishing venue, just as if a commercial publisher owned the journal.

  <b><i>STEP→ </i></b>Before proceeding, your editorial board should review any agreement you may have entered with the society to determine whether you are contractually constrained from starting or participating in a competing journal. If your editorial contract has such a clause, you should seek qualified legal advice before proceeding further.

  If qualified legal advice indicates that your editor’s agreement with the publisher prevents you from starting or participating in a new journal, then the editorial group’s options might be limited to:
  <ul>
    <li>Renewing negotiations with the publisher in an attempt to gain partial concessions that would increase the openness of the journal short of comprehensive open access. Such concessions might include broader author rights, such as more <a href="https://sparcopen.org/our-work/author-rights/">progressive self-archiving policies</a>.</li>
    <li>Resigning from the journal’s editorial board and withholding any future support for the journal (e.g., as authors, peer reviewers, etc.). Again, your behavior will need to conform with any qualified legal advice.</li>
  </ul>
  If the editorial agreement(s) do not attempt to prevent editors from starting or participating in a new journal, then an editorial board might seek to launch an alternative journal. See “Launching an Alternative Journal” section [LINK] for further guidance.
