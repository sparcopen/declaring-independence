## Please join me in DECLARING INDEPENDENCE from publishers and journals that do not serve the research community.

We scientists can exercise control of our journals. We can transform them from commercial commodities back to instruments of service to education and research. When we are in control, we fulfill our responsibility to ourselves, to society, to our institutions, and to our colleagues throughout the world.

In recent times, purely commercial interests have gained sway over too many of the journals that we depend on for research information. Maximizing profits has become the controlling goal. A system that should serve us is at the mercy of corporate acquisitions and profit-oriented planners. Disseminating scholarly research seems to be an afterthought.

I speak from first-hand experience of what happens when profits take over. In 1986, I started a journal in the field of evolutionary ecology. The initial subscription price was $35 per year for individuals, $100 for libraries. Within a twelve- year period, during which the journal changed ownership twice, the price for libraries had grown to nearly $800 per year, an average annual increase of 19%.

I did the math. I estimated that my publish- er pocketed profit of between $170,000 and $220,000 annually, a mark-up of about 275% and a profit margin of nearly 75%. After the second change in ownership, my editorial board and I launched our own independent, competitive journal,  Evolutionary Ecology Research.

Using common sense and prudent management, we have been able to set reasonable prices, use technology to speed up the review and publication process, and attract the leading lights of the field to our new journal.

We did it, and you can too. Though I would not recommend our strategy to everyone, there are alternatives to commercial publication. You can start by reviewing this handbook to deter- mine whether your journal serves the needs of its community. If it does not, you can use the handbook to explore and evaluate alternatives to your present situation.

We scientists are naturally curious explorers. Please be curious about the way your journal is run. And if you donâ€™t like what you find, explore ways of DECLARING INDEPENDENCE.
